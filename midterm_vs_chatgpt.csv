57,C,C,This method involves determining whether the p-value indicates sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis based on the chosen significance level (α).,TRUE,C,"We reject the null hypothesis if the p-value, which represents the probability of observing a result as extreme as or more extreme than the observed result under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, is less than the predefined significance level, α, which signifies the threshold for determining statistically significant results",TRUE,C,We reject the null hypothesis by comparing the p-value to a predefined α-significance level and rejecting if the p-value is smaller than α.,TRUE
58,B,C,"(given p-value table along with the question)Since the observed p-value of 0.03 falls in the range 0.05≥p>0.01, this indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis. ",FALSE,B,"A p-value of 0.03 falls within the range of 0.05 ≥ p > 0.01, which, according to the ""strength of evidence"" table repeatedly referenced in the sources and our conversation, indicates moderate evidence against the null hypothesis.",TRUE,B,"(given the p-value evidence table before the question) A p-value of 0.03 falls in the range of 0.05 ≥ p > 0.01, which provides moderate evidence against the null hypothesis.",TRUE
59,D,B,"Failing to reject the null hypothesis suggests that there is not enough evidence against it, which can be interpreted as providing support for the null hypothesis.",FALSE,D,"Hypothesis testing focuses on providing evidence against the null hypothesis, and failing to reject the null hypothesis simply means we lack sufficient evidence to reject it, not that we've found evidence supporting it, as explained in our conversation history and source.",TRUE,D,We do not provide evidence in favor of the null hypothesis; failing to reject it only indicates insufficient evidence against it.,TRUE
60,B,B,Setting an α-significance level of 0.05 means that we accept a 5% risk of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (Type I error) when it is actually true across analogous experiments.,TRUE,B,"The α-significance level represents the probability of making a Type I error, which is rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true12. A p-value of 0.03 is less than the specified α of 0.05, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis. However, there's still a 5% chance that this rejection is incorrect, meaning the null hypothesis is true despite the observed data.",TRUE,B,"With an α-significance level of 0.05, we would expect to make a Type I error, rejecting the null hypothesis wrongly, in 5% of similar experiments based on i.i.d. samples.",TRUE
